      <p>
        React Finland is organized as a community effort. All of us are
        developers and this shows in the conference.

      <p>
        Our goal is to connect our valued speakers with our local community in
        the most fruitful way we can and provide Finnish hospitality to our
        conference visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope to create something unique by combining our northern traditions
        with speakers and visitors from all around the world.
