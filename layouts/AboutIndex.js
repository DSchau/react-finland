        React Finland is organized as a community effort. All of us are
        developers and this shows in the conference.

        Our goal is to connect our valued speakers with our local community in
        the most fruitful way we can and provide Finnish hospitality to our
        conference visitors.

      <p>
        We hope to create something unique by combining our northern traditions
        with speakers and visitors from all around the world.
