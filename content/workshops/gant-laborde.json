      "Gant is a New Orleans-based force of nature. Not satisfied to be “just” an experienced programmer in an array of disciplines, he’s also a prolific writer, an award-winning public speaker, and an adjunct professor.\n\nA self-improvement aficionado, he takes every opportunity to connect with people and share knowledge through education and outreach. In the zombie apocalypse, Gant will run our much-needed bar, offering up advice, encouragement, and libations in equal measure.",
