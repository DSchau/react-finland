The event is run non-profit by *React Finland ry* by developers to developers. We have seen our share of better and worse events and will put the experience gained towards the best conference we can organize.

Our goal is to connect our valued speakers with out local community in the most fruitful way we can and provide Finnish hospitality to our conference visitors. We hope to create something unique by combining the northern tradition with speakers and visitors from all around the world.
