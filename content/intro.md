**React Finland** combines the Finnish React community with international flavor. The first of its kind in Finland, the event consists of a workshop day and two days of talks around the topic.

In this single track event you will learn more about React and surrounding topics while meeting some of the leading talents of the community.

The event will be held between 24th and 26th of April 2018 in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. In addition to enjoying the event, this is your chance to explore Finland.

We follow [Berlin code of conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

T> If there's enough demand, we'll organize a guided tour that helps you understand this mysterious country not many seem to know a lot about. You might have heard of Nokia or Linux but there's more to the country than that.
